# Exercise Plotter

The Exercise Plotter is a Python application made for plotting data typically
generated with sports watches. Both time series and single data values are
supported, and all should be possible to plot between different exercise
samples. Crossplots will be populated with any of the available data columns

The application consists of a Dash frontend to serve the user and a backend
using sqlite.

The code is written with the philosophy that it should be possible to add
support for different devices. The extent of the support will vary depending
on the implementation
